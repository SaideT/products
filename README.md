# Final Project for Data Wrangling Class

Data scraping from Twitter and Amazon for the topic of natural shampoos and conditioners

In the last decade, “natural” has become a tremendous popular topic in people’s daily life. But different people have different definition and understanding for the natural products. In this project, I selected the shampoo and conditioner as the study products. Two parts are involved. In first part, I analyzeed all tweets related with natural shampoo or natural conditioner. Based on the text analysis, we can have an idea of people’s understanding for the natural hair care products. In part two, I scraped and analyzed the information of shampoo and conditioner products from Amazon. Based on the results of part one, I can divide those products into natural and normal types. An investigational analysis is achieved to compare the unit price of different natural or normal products.
